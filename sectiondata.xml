        <h2>Welcome to My site!</h2>
        <p>I'm a photographer who believes in getting things right.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, photo editing is an undeniable part of the photography world these days, but most of the photos you see on this site are either completely unedited (either on the camera or on a computer) or have only been edited to better represent how the scene <i>really</i> appeared.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to look around my site using the tabs above, browse the galleries and perhaps even drop me a line in the contact section - I'm always open to requests or suggestions for shoots, from original concepts to imitations and everything in between.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>I'm a photographer, a programmer and a musician. I also do a little web development (I made this website myself!). I do what I do because I enjoy it, and I believe in making a good job of things.</p>
        <p>Photography started out as a hobby - when I saw something that made me think 'wow', I wanted to capture an image that would wow other people just as much.</p>
        <p>I've been a professional photographer since 2009, when I expanded from landscape and travel photography to include concerts and weddings as well as glamour and portraiture. <br />
        My photography folio is featured on this site for you to browse. You can also find links to my programming and music websites.</p>
        <p>Please contact me if you're interested in ordering prints or working with me, either as a photographer, musician or developer.</p>
        <p>This website will be eventually provide you with an automated prints odering service.</p>
